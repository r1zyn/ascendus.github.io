# Contributing to this repository
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We develop with GitHub
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accepting pull requests.

## We use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
This means all changes to the code happens through pull requests. Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Add your code.
3. Issue that pull request!

## Contributions will be under the BSD 3 Clause License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [The BSD 3 Clause Licens](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause)) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [Issues](https://github.com/Ascendus/ascendus.github.io/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/Ascendus/ascendus.github.io/issues); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report I wrote, and I think it's not a bad model. Here's [another example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408), an app developer whom I greatly respect.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. [My stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) includes sample code that *anyone* with a base R setup can run to reproduce what I was seeing
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a consistent coding style

* Use tabs (4 spaces) for indentations
* Remember semi-colons at the end of single lines in JavaScript/TypeScript files
* Use double quotes
